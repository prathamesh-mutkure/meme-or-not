A platform to vote weather a meme is funny or not. There are three types of people involved in the whole flow
1. Meme Template creators: They create templates on the platform and add a certain percentage which would determine the total cut they would get out of the pool.
2. Meme Creators: They create memes out of the templates and act as source of marketing for the particular meme.
3. Meme Consumers: They consume the memes created out of the templates. They have the option to right swipe to say a meme if **Funny** or **Lame**.
